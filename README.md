# Query

A lightweight ES6 query selector that works with native JavaScript methods. It will support all queries supported with .querySelectorAll() [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll).

#### Tested browsers
* Chrome Desktop 54.0.2840.99 m
* Edge 14.14393
* FireFox 49.0.2

This will need to be transpiled to support older browsers like Internet Explorer.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/ronhook/query/wiki) for a full list of methods.
